The ruler, Artaxis II - who had taken the throne by allying with the Parthians and removing Mark Anthony's son, Alexander Helios from power in 33 BCE and then massacred all Romans in the Armenian garrisons - was unpopular with his people. A request was sent to Emperor Augustus to depose him and put his brother Tigranes III (who was being held in political exile in Rome) on the throne. Augustus agreed and a huge army was sent to carry out the plan. However, while they were enroute to depose him, a coup within the palace resulted in the murder of Artaxis in 20 BCE. The Armenian crown became the centre of the ongoing conflict between the Romans and Parthians, and the people of Armenia were eventually divided between pro-Parthian and pro-Roman parties which led to civil war. Tigranes III died before 8 BCE and his son Tigranes IV and daughter Erato became joint rulers of the throne. They were also anti-Roman and looked to Parthia for support. However, to avoid total war with Rome, the Parthians under Phraates V stopped supporting the Armenian king and queen, who then had to submit to Rome in order to stay in power, further dividing the country which had descended into chaos. While the war was ongoing, the Artaxiad dynasty weakened and gradually petered out: Tigrane IV died in battle in 1 CE, possibly fighting a revolt, and Erato later abdicated. Although distant relatives of the Artaxiad dynasty were placed on the throne, Armenian was a Roman protectorate under Emperor Augustus and the dyanasty finally collapsed in 6 CE.","Hovannisian, Richard G. 1998.

There were three major Hmong uprisings in the seventeeth and eighteenth centuries. The first in 1735-36 was raised in rebellion against the misrule of the Qing. At first local Qing administrators sought to come to an agreement with the rebels but the Qianlong Emperor sent in armies who supressed the uprising, killing 18,000 warriors. Thereafter fifty years of peace in the region persisted until 1795 when the Hmong in Hunnan rose up again against Han Chinese immigrants who were forcing them out of their traditional lands and were quickly followed by the Chinese state who put a strain on local resources and established their own settlements there. Again military action was taken, and in the aftermath in 1806 policies banning Hmong traditional dress and ethnic segregation were put in place, as well as their lands being confiscated. Tensions simmered and culminated with the largest Miao Rebellion in Guizhou 1854-73. This rebellion was a string of uprisings by multiple rebel groups who won some battles against the Chu army and captured several towns as well as attacking the capital of Guiyang. With the Taiping Rebellion also happening at the same time, the Qing armies were stretched, however once the Taiping Rebellion had been supressed, the Qing government turned their attention fully to the Hmong rebels, defeating them one by one. In the aftermath many areas of Guizhou were depopulated and the destroyed towns and overgrown farmlands led many of the Hmong and other ethnic groups to migrate to Vietnam and Laos.

The rebellion is considered the worst civil war in history which left an estimated 20-30 million people dead. The Taiping, led by Hong Xiuquan, established the Heavenly Kingdom as an oppositional state, who wished to overthrow the Qing dynasty and convert people to the Taiping version of Christianity (Xiuquan claimed to be the brother of Jesus Christ). In the first few years of the war, the Taipings invaded and captured lands in Guangxi, Yuezhou, Wuchang and lands along the Yangtze River, including the city of Nanjing in 1853 which was declared the Taiping capital, and later the wealthy regions of southern Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces. Both sides carried out massacres: The Taiping against the Manchu people, and the Wing government against the civilians of Nanjing. The Qing dynasty were ultimately victorious although they were severely weakened and collapsed just 50 years later.","Reilly, Thomas H. (2011).

Western Jin Dynasty,265,317,Revolts of the Imperial Princes,IV c,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,5,"Revolts of the Imperial Princes was a period of complex power struggles, intense civil wars and intervals of peace between princes of royal dynasties and Empress Jia, following the death of Emperor Wu of Jin in 290 CE. Empress Yang Zhi, the stepmother of the Emperor, Hui of Jin (who was developmentally impaired) and her family wielded the most power at court. In 291 CE Hui of Jin's wife, Empress Jia Nanfeng, enlisted the help of Sima Liang (Prince Wencheng of Ru'nan) Sima Wei (Prince Yin of Chu) and sought to take control by having Yang Zhi's father executed for treason, imprisoning and starving Empress Yang Shi to death, and executing 3000 other members of the Yang clan. Sima Liang (the emperor's grand-uncle) became regent, but because of his threats to Sima Wei over his conduct, Wei and Empress Jia accussed Liang of treason and Wei led a coup to kill Liang. After Liang's death, Jia spread rumours that Wei had forged the royal edict to have Liang killed. Wei was deserted by his followers, captured and executed. Empress Jia ruled the court, under the name of her husband, until 300 CE by which time her behaviour (both personally and politically) caught up with her. In 299 CE Jia orchestrated the arrest and pushed for the execution of Sima Yu who was heir to the throne, however Emperor Hui instead had him deposed and kept him under house arrest. Following this, Sima Lun (Prince of Guangling) advised Jia to have Sima Yu assasinated as he was still a threat to the succession. However, Sima Lun later used Jia's assasination of Yu to overthrow her in 300 CE, placed her under house arrest and forced her to commit suicide. He welcomed back Yu's sons, Sima Zang and Sima Shang. However, in 301 CE Sima Lun usurped the throne from Emperor Hui, who was placed under house arrest, and killed Crown Prince Zang. Sima Yun ( Prince of Huainan) rebelled against Lun, but was killed by one of Lun's supporters. Four princes then allied to oppose Lun; in Xuchang, the Prince of Qi, Sima Jiong; in Chang'an, the Prince of Hejian, Sima Yong; in Chengdu, the Prince of Chengdu, Sima Ying; and Sima Ai, Prince of Changsha. In May 301 CE, after violent battles, betrayals, rebellions and executions, the coalition's troops entered the palace and arrested Lun, who was executed a few days later. Hun Hui was restored later that year. Sima Jiong became regent in August 301 CE. In 302 CE Jiong made the Emperor's nephew, Sima Tan, the crown prince and Sima Yue, Prince of Donghai, as director of the Central Secretariat. Later that year, after receiving an apparent imperial decree to eliminate Jiong, Sima Yong, along with Sima Ying, rasied a rebellion against Jiong. Sima Ai was wrongly implicated and fled to the imperial palace for protection where he defended the palace against Jiong with personal and imperial guards. Jiong's own officers betrayed him and he was captured and killed. Sima Ai siezed control of the capoital but deferred authority to his brother, Sima Ying. In April 304 CE Ying deposed his nephew, Sima Tan, and appointed himself crown prince. Sima Yue led a rebellion to restore Tan to his position however he was defeated in battle. After this, many rebellions were raised against Sima Ying, including some by leaders of the Han clan, who had a force three times that of Ying. Ying's remaining 15,000 troops deserted him and he was forced to flee to Luoyang, where Emperor Hui was taken into care by military general Zhang Fang. They were taken tho Chang'an where Ying was imprisoned and stripped of his titles by Sima Yong. Sima Chi (another grandson of Emperor Wu) was given the title of Crown Prince. In mid-305 CE Sima Yue and several other princes raised an army and rebelled against Sima Yong with the intention to take Emperor Hui back to Luoyang. Yong freed Sima Ying in order to gain his assistance in the rebellion. In battle, Yue defeated Yong's forces. Yue negotiated by offering the divide the empire with Yong, however Zhang Fang advised against this and urged him to keep fighting. Yong then had Zhang Fang executed and sent his head to Yue as part of a peace offering. However Yue then decided to keep fighting, conquered Chang'an, and secured his place as the real power over the imperial court, which he moved back to Luoyang. Sima Yong fled to Chaoge and was put under house arrest by Sima Xiao, however Xiao died mysteriously a month later and his successor, Liu Yu, forged an edict to execute Ying. Lu Zhi then took up a position at court with Sima Yue. Meanwhile, Sima Yong had raised another rebellion and captured Chang'an. In January 307 Emperor Hui died of poisoning and his brother, Sima Chi (posthumously Emperor Huai of Jin) suceeded as Emperor. Sima Yong was summoned to court, which he believed was for a pardon, but en route he was killed in an ambush. The last remaining prince, Sima Yue, had won victory in the War of the Princes, but died a year later of stress among court plots on his life.","di Cosmo, Nicola (2009), Military Culture in Imperial China, Harvard University Press. p.116-136 $ Graff, David A.

The new king, Sigismund, launched a crusade against the Hussites in 1420 but any land that was taken was recaptured by the Hussites. Attempting to capitalise on internal strife among the Hussites, Germany undertook another crusade in 1421, followed by a crusade led by the papacy in 1423, though they were both unsucessful and the Germans were forced to seek peace in 1424. In 1426 and 1427 the Hussites were attacked again by a Roman Catholic crusader force but defeated both attempts at invasion. Peace talks were attempted but the Roman Cathlic Church launched a final crusade in an attempt to subjugate the Hussites in 1431, though the Hussites were again victorious. Lengthy negotiations led to further infighting of the Hussites culminating in 1434 with the victory of the moderate Utrquist faction against the radical Taborite faction. It was agreed that the Hussites would accept the authority of the king of Bohemia and the Catholic Church and in return were allowed to practice their own form of christianity. The Religious Peace of Kutn√° Hora declared that Utraquist and Catholic faiths were equal in law. Bohemian lands and population had been ravaged by the wars and the effects were felt for many years after, with some estimates showing that the population fell from around 2.80-3.37 million in 1400 to  1.50-1.85 million by 1526.","Setton, Kenneth Meyer (1975), A History of the Crusades: The fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, Univ of Wisconsin Press, p. 604. $  Verney, Victor. 2009.

Otto overcame these revolts and went on to take full control of the appointment of all dukes. Otto was crowned emperor by Pope John XII in 962, marking the German kings as successors to the Empire of Charlemagne, and minigling the political affairs of the German kingdom with the papacy and Italy. The following year Otto had Pope John XII deposed and replaced him with Leo VIII resulting in conflict with the Eastern Roman emperor in Constantinople. In 976 Otto II's rule was challenged by his cousin Henry Duke of Bavaria, who raised a failed rebellion against the king, and was imprisoned. However after Otto II's death, Henry was released from prison. Otto III came to the throne at the age of three, resulting in several regencies and power struggles until he came of age in 996. The regent Crescentius II led a failed revolt against Otto III shortly after his succession. Henry claimed the regency and it was granted by Archbishop of Cologne Warin. Over the years Henry formed alliances and openly contested his claim to the throne. Those who opposed his ideas went to Saxony to conspire against him, but he sent his armies to stop the opposition. Negotioations broke down and as he feared that civil war would break out eventually Henry relinqueshed his regency of Otto III. When Otto III died suddenly in 1002 with no heirs there was a succession crisis which eventually led to Henry duke of Bavaria's son becoming King Henry II. Henry II waged several wars against Poland during his reign. He was crowned emperor in 1014. When Henry II died in 1024, he had no children, and no relations in the Ottonian line to succeed him, so was the last of the Ottonian line to be Holy Roman Emperor.

After two years of internal conflict over territories, Uthman demanded the sultanate after being lobbied by his father's emirs, which was later settled after a series of assaults against his brother, Al-Afadl's domain of Damascus. Uthman's other brother, al-'Adil became a lieutenant under him and weilded considerable influence. Upon Uthman's death in 1198, al-Afdal was made sultan again in Al-Adil's absense. Al-Adil returned from campaign and the two entered into a two year war, which resulted in al-Adil's victory in 1200. A devestating famine hit in 1200, which forced some parts of the population into cannabilism. During al-Adil's reign, he also had to contend with assaults by the Kingdom of Georgia and the Crusader campaigns between 1217-1218. Al-Adil died after the loss of Damietta to the Crusaders.

His son Barakah had succeeded to the throne, but after a revolt in 1279 he was forced to abdicate. His brother, Solamish, took the throne but the real power laid with Qalawun, a former Mamluk soldier and emir.  As Solamish was only seven years old Qalawun successfully became ruler under the title al-Malik al-Man·π£≈´r and sent Solamish into exile. The govenor of Damascus, Dungur, challenged Qalawun's authority, proclaiming himself sultan, however he was defeated in battle in 1280. In 1281 the Ilkhanate (part of the Mongol Empire) took advantage of the ongoing succession struggles and invaded Syria. Qalawun and Sungur had reconciled to repel this attack and succesfully defeated the Ilkhanate. Between 1285-1289 Qalawun launched several successful attacks on Crusader strongholds and brought down the Crusader County of Tripoli. Qalawun put a policy in place to replace Turkish Mamluks with Circassians, which his son, Khalil continued when he succeded to the throne. However, this caused conflict with the Mamluks and Khalil was assasinated by them in 1293. Khalil's nine-year-old brother, Al-Nasir, became sultan but the power laid with two emirs: Kitbugha, who was of Mongol origin, and the Turkic al-Shuja‚Äòi. Their own rivalry led to the murder of al-Shuja‚Äòi, which in turn led to Kitbugha removing the Burji Mamluks from the citadel, who then rebelled and rampaged in Cairo. An-Nasir also sought revenge for the death of his brother, which Kitbugha had been involved in, but instead Kitbugha deposed the young sultan and declared himself sultan in his place. In 1296 Kitbugha was deposed by his vice-sultan, Lajin, who ruled until he was murdered along with his vice-sultan in 1299 by a group of emirs. An-Nasir was reinstated as sultan, however as he was only 14 years old, he was once again only a nominal sultan and the actual rulers were the emirs Salar and Baibars (who had led the coup).

During this period the Mamluk ruling class carried out extravagant construction projects and mismanaged the disasters that befell the population and several rebellions were raised in Cairo.

Habsburg Spanish Empire,1521,1808,Eighty Years' War and plague in Habsburg Spain,XVII c,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,"This fifty year period saw a succession of crises for the Habsburg Spanish Empire. In 1568 the protestant William of Orange led a revolt against the spanish in the Netherlands and attempted to remove the Duke of Alva from the region. Though his attempt failed, this is considered the beginning of the Eighty Years War. Between 1572-1579 many Dutch rebels denounced Spanish rule and set about seizing Dutch coastal towns, destroying dykes, and looting southern towns which then joined the rebellion. The Spanish ended the rebellion by negotiating the Union of Arras in 1579, which saw Spanish troops leave the region. In 1584 William of Orange was murdered by a Catholic, leading to the intervention of protestant Queen Elizabeth I of England who sent British ships to attack Spanish merchants, and later the Spanish Armada, which was defeated. In 1590 when the protestant Henry IV became the successor to the crown of France, the Spanish who had been invovled in the religious warfare of France for many years, diverted half of their army from the Netherlands to France in an attempt to stop Henry becoming king. Spain were now at war with the Netherlands, England and France and could not sustain their efforts due to the great expense, which bankrupted them in 1596. In the same year Habsburg Spain suffered a plague which had entered from the north coast. This outbreak of plague was particularly destructive and within six years it had spread across the entire of mainland Spain and killed an estimated 500,000 people. In 1598, Phillip II made a peace treaty with France, and stopped payments to the Catholic League after Henry IV converted to Catholicism. Shortly afterwards Phillip died and his son, Phillip III came to power. Phillip III's government went about mass producing worthless currency in an attempt to pay for budget deficits, which caused inflation and led to bankruptcy again by 1607. Since 1590, Maurice of Nassau, son of William of Orange, had been successful in retaking several border cities in the Netherlands. The Spanish army attempted to reconquer the Netherlands but the 1607 bankruptcy prevented them from doing so. However, as the United Provinces were politically divided, Spain was able to convince them to sign the Twelve Years' Truce in 1609.","Kohn, George C. 2001.

Spanish Empire II,1716,1814,Mexican War of Independence,XIX c,U.susp,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,5,"Mexico's civil war and independance from Spain was not a single centralised war, but a succession of simultaneous regional and local conflicts. Calls for independance had been simmering for some time, but when Napolean Bonapart invaded Spain, deposed Charles IV, and placed his own brother, Joseph on the Spainish throne. In 1810 this led to a crisis surrounding the legitimacy of crown rule and the instability that occured in Europe and in turn in New Spain triggered the first rebellions by Penninsula- and American-born Spaniards against Spanish rule. The very first uprising, led by the Catholic priest, professor and viceroy Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla in September 1810, saw almost 90,000 men join the quickly powerful, albiet disorganised, forces against the government. They captured towns along their marching route to Mexico City, had several successful battles against the royalist forces, and were joined by more people as they went.  However they suffered a devestating loss at Guadalajara in January 1811, and in July Hidalgo was arrested, found guilty of treason and executed. Although conflict in the north waned, the rebel forces eventually regrouped under Jos√© Mar√≠a Morelos who was organised and created a clear plan and demands for independance. In the meantime the Peninsular War saw Napolean defeated and Ferdinand VII succeeded the Spanish throne, who reneged on his promises to rule constitutionallly and reinstated absolutism. Back in New Spain, after several successful campaigns, Morelos was captured by the royal army in November 1815 and was tried and executed. Guerilla warfare continued throughout the region, particularly in southern Mexico, and Vicente Guerrero emerged as a leader for the insurgency. As conventional warfare has ended, the Spanish government offered a pardon to any insurgent who laid down their arms. Many did, but later returned to the rebel forces, particularly in the countryside which the government did not have under full control. In 1820, the failed royalist expedition of Oaxaca coincided with the overthrow of Ferdinand VII by Spanish liberals in a military coup in 1820. In New Spain conservatives and rebels saw an opportunity to cement their independance and allied under the Plan of Iguala, creating their own army, the Army of the Three Guarantees. Many royalists and soldiers, seeing that the Spanish cause was lost, defected to the Army of Three Guarantees. In August 1821 the  Treaty of C√≥rdoba was signed by Spanish representatives On 27th September 1821 the Army of the Three Guarantees marched into Mexico and the following day the Declaration of Independence of the Mexican Empire was proclaimed. Mainland New Spain was reorganised as the Mexican Empire, however it lasted only two years, the Catholic monarchy was overthrown and it was declared a federal republic in 1823.","Noll, Arthur Howard; McMahon, Amos Philip (1910).

French Kingdom - Late Bourbon,1660,1788,French Revolution,XVIII c,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,8,"The causes of the French Revolution are agreed to have been social, political and economic issues which the Ancien Regime were unable to rectify and manage. It began in 1789 with the Estates General, an assembly representing the estates of the realm: the clergy (First Estate), the nobility (Second Estate), and the commoners (Third Estate), which had been called to discuss the financial crisis but fell into debate about it's own structure of governance. The Third Estate formed the independant National Assembly to protest the voting by power rather than by head (as they had double the representation but was not counted as such) against the wishes of King Louis XVI, which signalled the beginning of the French Revolution. Members of the First and Second Estates later joined them and it was converted to the National Constituents Assembly on 9th July 1789 though Louis XVI attempted to shut down the assembly. This was followed by the Storming of the Bastille on 14th July 1789 , the armoury, fortress and political prison which represented royal authority and to the rebels, the abuse of the monarchy's power. After this French nobles and royalty began to leave France as √©migr√©s. Revolts and panic known as the Great Fear spread across the country while 'popular sovereignty' became widespread and parallel structures of civic goverment and militias began to be established. At the same time, Paris and the north of France suffered an outbreakof influenza. The National Constituents Assembly passed the August Decrees between 4-11 August 1789, several radical reforms with strong support from the public which included the right to vote for tax-paying men over the age of 25 years, the abolition of feudalism, and the end of the exemption of taxes of nobles, essentially abolishing the Ancien R√©gime. In November 1790 the church was brought under state control. By 1790 the Bastille had been demolished. During this period France also suffered the breakout of the French Revolutionary Wars which pitted France against Great Britain, Austria, the Holy Roman Empire, Prussia, Russia, and were divided in two periods: the War of the First Coalition (1792-97) and the War of the Second Coalition (1798-1802). The First French Republic was formed on 21st September 1792 and officially abolished the monarchy in France. Louis XVI was put on trial for crimes of high treason, convicted on 16th January 1793 and executed on the 21st January, shortly followed by the execution of his wife, Marie Antoinette. In the same year the Reign of Terror began amid anticlerical sentiments, rebellions against conscription, and ongoing food riots and mass hunger. to eradicate counter-revolutionaires. By the time the Terror ended in July 1794, around 17,000 peoplehad been executed and an estimated 10,000 more died in prison. Royalist and Jacobin revolts ensued in the following years. The Revolution ended with the formation of the French Consulate, the new government of France, in November 1799.","Richard Cobb and Colin James. The French Revolution.

The House of Valois were ultimately victorious and kept control over France. The Black Death (bubonic and pneumonic plague) hit both France and England in 1348 during the Edwardian Wars, which killed an estimated one-third to a half of both populations. The resulting decline in population and resource production after the plague led to revolts in both rural and urban areas due to the fianancial reforms and taxes that the crown imposed to make up for the loss of revenue. During the Lancastrian War, Henry V of England invaded and conquered Normandy in 1415 and secured himself as heir to the French throne in the Treaty of Troyes of 1420 (which passed on to his son Henry VI).

As the royal capital, Parisian citizens suffered considerably during the wars as the rulers imposed taxes on them to support themselves and their battles, as well as a huge number of troops stationed at the city, which led to famines and later epidemic diseases such as Diptheria in 1576 and Whooping Cough 1579 among other illnesses that affected a highly populated and unsanitary city. During the War of the Three Henrys (1587-1589) King Henry III had Henry of Guise murdered (some believed assasinated as at this point he was a choice for king) and he joined forces with his cousin, the  Huguenot, King Henry of Navarre (House of Bourbon). In response the Catholic League incitied violence against the king and in July 1589 Henry III was assasinated by a friar. Henry of Naverre succeeded to the French throne as Henry IV, which was followed immideately by a four year civil war against the Catholic League who recognised Henry's cardinal uncle, Charles of Bourbon, as the rightful heir. Henry IV, held the south and west of France, and the Catholic League the north and east, including Paris. However when Charles died in 1590 and Henry converted to Catholicism in 1593, as he recognised that he needed to reunite the kingdom and simply could not as a Protestant, he was recognised across the kingdom as king and conflicts ceased. It is estimated that three million people died from the violence of the conflicts, famine or disease during this period.","Knecht, R.J. 1989. The French Wars of Religion, 1559-1598.

Anglo-Saxon England,410,1066,Norman Invasion and Conquest,XI c,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,2,"The Norman invasion and conquest of England in 1066 was led by William Duke of Normandy, later King William I, and styled as William the Conqueror. William led a coalition army comprised of Normans, Bretons, Flemish and French Province soldiers in his claim to the English throne after the death of Edward the confessor in the same year. Edward had no legitimate heirs and his brother-in-law, Harold Godwinson, had succeeded to the throne. However both William and Harold men claimed that Edward had promised the throne to them. William also recruited Harold's exiled brother, Tostig Godwinson, and the Norweigian king Harald Hardrada to his cause. Tostig and Harald invaded the north of England in January 1066 and by September they had captured York. However Harold and his forces marched north and defeated the Tostig and Harald armies, killing the leaders in the Battle of Stamford Bridge. However, a few days later, William sailed to England, landing in Sussex where Harold's naval forces had dispersed. When Harold discovered that William had landed, he immeditely marched his army back south, though he was forced to leave a large portion of his troops in the north. On 14th October the day-long Battle of Hastings began and Harold was killed in the battle while the English forces were decimated. However the surviving English did not submit to his claim and instead declared that Edgar the √Ütheling would be king. William then marched to London, defeating an English force at southwark and then onto Wallingford to receive the submission of Archbishop Stigand and eventually, as they could not muster forces to repel William, from the English nobles as well. William was crowned king on 25th December 1066.","Huscroft, Richard (2009). The Norman Conquest: A New Introduction. New York: Longman. $ Lawson, M. K. (2002). The Battle of Hastings: 1066.

Early Modern England,1642,1836,English Civil War,XVII c,1.inf,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,5,"The English Civil War was a series of conflicts that took place between the Royalist ""Cavaliers"" who supported Charles I and and the Divine Right of Kings, and the Parliamentarian ""Roundheads"" who sought a governance that was led by a permenant Parliament to whom the monarch was answerable.  Initially there had been concerns over Charles I's marriage to the French Catholic Henrietta Maria and his sympathies (and own beliefs) towards Catholics, while England was a Protestant country. Charles also dissolved parliament whenever they raised concerns over his governance and essentially only called them when he required financial assistance and otherwise imposed 'forced loans' or compelled citizens to accomodate, feed and clothe his soliders. Failiure to do either resulted in imprisonment which gained mass opposition across society. In 1628 he called parliament to raise funds for and in exchange he reluctantly accepted the Petition of Right which stated that no person is compelled to priovide gift, loan, or tax, nor house soldiers in private accomodation. Charles did not call parliament for a further decade, known as Personal Rule of Charles I or Eleven Years' Tyranny, and instead raised money by creating fines, naval taxes, and reviving outdated systems. He also began introducing elements of Catholicism into the churches. Puritans who compained about this were arrested and punished. When Charles attempted to apply the same religious changes in Scotland, the rebellion of the Bishops War broke out in 1639 and again in the mid-1640s. Charles' unsuccessful attempts to surpress the rebeillions led to the Scottish occupation of Northumberland and Durham, and put an even bigger drain on his already depleting funds. He finally called parliament again in 1640 to raise funds, but with his weak position Parliment took the opportunity to raise all the grievances they had, impose laws restricting the kings power without parliamentary consent, and pass a law that parliament must covene at least once every three years even without the monarchs approval. Over the next two years the animosity between Charles and his supporters and the parliamentarians grew in all levels of society and war seemed inevitable. The final push came in 1642 when Charles attempted unsucessfully to arrest five members of the House of Commons for treason. This triggered a sudden spread of conflict, and though many regions and people attempted to remain neutral, actions and policies on both sides pressured a further division across the country and war broke out in June 1642. As both sides marched around the country they collected supports and soldiers along the way. Though the early part of the war seemed favourable to the Royalists, the tide turned when the Parliamentary 'New Model Army' won two major battles and then brought the Scots into their forces. Eventually, Charles' resources were depleted and he sought refuge with a Scottish army. He was promptly turned over to Parliament and imprisoned in May 1646, which ended the first war. However there was no question at this stage that Charles would remain king though there was a power vaccum that could be filled by the three factions that had come out of the war: the Royalists, Independents of the New Model Army (""the Army""), and the Presbyterians of the English Parliament, and whichever was to suceed as the victorious group, must also have Charles (who flattered and plotted with each party) as its head to be successful. In June 1647 the Army, having grown more powerful and ever distant from the Presbytarian parliament, seized Charles for themselves, while parliament, the remaining royalists and the Scots banded together to being the second civil war against them. Charles negotiated a secret treaty with the Scots in December 1647 who agreed to invade England and restored him if if converted to presbytarianism within three years. Skirmishes between all parties occured over the following year and while the Army led many successful battles against their rivals, many defected to their side. Their final victory at the Battle of Preston over the Royalists and Scots secured their victory and marked the end of the second war. Negotiations opened up again between parliament and Charles, but the Army marched on them and conducted 'Pride's Purge' preventing mebers access to parliament and arresting 45 of them. Few were allowed in, and only on the bidding of the Army, who demanded that a High Court of Justice was set up to try Charles I for high treason due to his inciting of war, pacts and treaties made with various groups, and forcing those who had previously sworn an oath after the first civil war to take up arms again. Charles was found guilty and was beheaded on 30th January 1649. England became a republic, led by the new parliament, with Oliver Cromwell as Lord Protector. Charles I's son, Charles who was in exile, was immediately proclaimed King Charles II of England in Jersey after the execution of his father. In June 1650 he landed in Scotland to raise an army, and was offered the Scottish crown. However, Crowell marched his army to Edinburgh where they laid siege to the city and defeated a Scottish army at Dunbar. Cromwell then persued Charles southwards, where the army engaged and defeated Charles II's forces at Worcester. Charles managed to escape, hiding via a network of loyalists houses, until he was able to flee to France in 16th October 1651. In the meantime, Ireland had been suffering its own rebellions and ongiong wars against anti-Catholicism since 1641 and in 1649 Cromwell's forces under the Army suppressed rebel royalists and catholics on the island, massacring nearly 3,500 people including civilians, preists, prisoners and soldiers. By 1653 the final Irish Confederate and Royalist troops surrendered and all Irish Catholic owned land was confiscated and given to members of the new parliament and Army soldiers.

Plantagenet England,1144,1485,Wars of the Roses,XIV-XV c,1.inf,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,7,"The Wars of the Roses was a series of dynastic civil wars between the English houses of Lancester and York, both of which claimed descendancy through the sons of Edward III who had died in 1377. The Lancastrians had occupied the throne since 1399, however, the reign of Henry VI (first reign 1422-1461, second reign 1470-1471) saw political and royal instability as he suffered from mental illnesses, and was generally considered a weak leader and pliable king, who was dominated by his wife, Margaret of Anjou and his top advisor, Duke of Somerset. Poor leadership, broken treaties and battles with France had lost England almost all territory in France and left English forces weak and disparate.  While Henry VI was suffering a complete mental breakdown the Lord Chancellor, Cardinal John Kemp died in March 1454, however as Henry was unable to name a successor, the governement could not function under constitutional law. A Regency Council was created and Richard of York - second cousin to Henry VI and a powerful member of the nobility who had a competing claim to the throne - was made Lord Protector. Richard of York removed Somerset from his position due to his failures in France, and imprisoned him in the Tower of London. In 1455 Henry made a recovery, freed Somerset, and exile Richard from court. From this point there were constant skirmishes between the Lancastrian and York armies and a power struggle between Henry VI, who was constantly captured and recaptured by the opposing sides,  and Richard of York, who had made his ambitions to rule clear and was backed by any powerful allies. But in a battle in 1460 Richard was killed and his eldest son, Edward, inherited the Dukedom of York and with it the claim to the throne. Edward was popular and considered a good choice for king (especially in contrast to Henry VI who was physically and mentally frail) and after a victorious battle Edward, along with his closest advisor and cousin, Richard Neville, Earl of Warwick ('The Kingmaker') marched to London where he was proclaimed Edward IV of England 4th March 1461. On 28th March the largest and bloodiest battle in England's history was fought between the two sides which resulted in a decisive victory for Edward IV and broke the Lancastrian troops in the north with the majority of their leaders either being killed or fleeing into exile. Edward IV was confirmed the uncontested ruler of England. He secretly married Elizabth Woodville, a non-royal who was the widow of a Lancastrian noble, while Warwick had been in negotiations with France for a marriage between Edward and the king's daughter. This caused damage to Warwick's reputation and relationship with Edward, while the Woodville family became increasingly powerful at court. This was despised by many royals including Warwick, and Edwards brother George, Duke of Clarence, who was attempting to secure a marriage contract with Warwick's daughter Isabel Neville, which Edward denied. Warwick instead had them married secretly in France and it became clear that he wished to deposed Edward, put George on the throne and keep power for himself. In a complete reversal, Warwick then joined forces with Margaret of Anjou, married his other daughter Anne Neville to her son Edward of Westminster and raised a rebellion against Edward IV. Edward was forced to flee to Flanders with his brother Richard, and was dethroned, while Henry was restored to the throne with Warwick in full control, and George was made Duke of York. However in-fighting was rife on the now Lancastrian-Warwick side, given the deaths that had come of so many in previous battles at the hands of Warwick, and George who had now become politcally disadvantaged on both sides decided to defect back to his brother. Edward raised his army, and despite Warwick being severly weakened without Margaret's troops, the two met in battle on 14th April 1417, where Warwick was killed, his troops destroyed and Edward was reinstated as king. Henry was once again imprisoned in the Tower of London. A final unsuccessful campaign by Margaret of Anjou saw her imprisoned, her son Edward of Westminster killed in battle, and afterward Henry VI died, though it is generally believed that Edward IV ordered his murder to quell further uprisings. In the years that followed George continued to abuse his power and fell out of favour with Edward, while Richard married Anne Neville. The two brothers had acquired many rich estates through their marriages which were untouchable by Edward as they were not gifted by him, but inherited through Warwick. Eventually George's bad favour and persistent rumours that he was plotting to revolt against Edward led to his imprisonment and execution in February 1478. Meanwhile, Richard who had always been loyal to Edward, had become a powerful and popular noble, particularly in the north and York. Edward fell ill in 1483 but before he died he named Richard as Lord Protector to act as regent over his twelve year old son and successor, Edward, until he came of age. There was backlash from the Woodville family who had thought they would look after the young king and Elizabeth sent her brother, Anthony with the king and an escort of 2,000 men to London, even though Richard had intended to escort the king. With support from powerful nobles, Richard had Anthony and their brother Richard Grey, and chamberlain Thomas Vaughan sent north and despite promises, he later had them executed in June 1483. In the meantime he had Edward and his younger brother, Richard of Shrewbury made residents of the Tower of London and kept stalling on Edward's coronation despite the king's councillors urging him to do so. Richard later accused Lord chamberlain the Baron of Hastings, a staunch supporter of Edward, of treason and had him executed, and he believed rumours that Edward IV and Elizabeth Woodville's married was void and therefore Edward V and his siblings would be illigetimate. So, on 22nd June, the date on which Edward V was supposed to be coronated, Richard ordered a sermon to be preached ourside St Paul's cathedral which declared him the righful king and he was crowned Richard III on 6th July 1983. During this time, the princes in the tower had not been seen and had disappeared by the time of Richards coronation. Their fate remains a mystery but it is widely believed that Ricahrd had them murdered to cement his claim to the throne. Betrayed, alone and stripped of her titles and power, Elizabeth Woodville attempted to ally with the Lancastrian Margaret Beaufort, whose son was a great-great-great-grandson of Edward III and so had a tenous claim to the throne, which Woodville proposed to be strengthened if he married her own daughter, Elizabeth. With this alliance and many disaffected nobles abandoning Richard, Henry's claim was supported and he raised an army from Brittany where he had been exiled for protection since Edward IV had regained the throne in 1471. The first uprising was unsuccessful and Henry was forced to retreat back to France. However, Charles VIII of France supported his claim, gave him refuge and resources to prepare for a second attack. In the meantime King Richard's wide, Anne Neville, dies and rumours spread that she had been murdered so that Richard could marry his niece, Elizabeth and stop the Tudor plans. Finally the Tudor forces from both England and France gathered against Richard's army on 22 August 1485 at the Battle of Bosworth, where Richard's army was decisively defeated. King Richard was killed in battle and Henry claimed the throne by the right of conquest. Shortly after he and his troops arrived back in London, the 'Sweating Sickness' broke out - possibly brought back from being spread at the battlefield - which killed thousands of people by late October. Many people believed that the sickness was sent by God as punishment for supporting Henry's reign. Regardless, he was crowned Henry VII of England on 30th October 1485. He married Elizabeth of York on 18th January 1486, which united the houses of Lancaster and York as their children would be descendants of both dynasties.","Webster, Bruce (1998).

Victorian United Kingdom,1837,1901,Chartist Movement,XIX c,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"The Chartist Movement sought reform in the politics of Britain and was raised first in 1838. The original Reform Act which had been passed in 1832 did not extend the vote to those who did not own property and this, combined with the Poor Law Amendment of 1834 which took away outdoor relief (in the form of money, clothes and food for the poor) and championed the workhouses, drew a huge wave of opposition from the working class and their political leaders. The movement quickly gained traction, particularly in the poorer, northern, industrial areas, and soon spread across the country and in 1836 the  London Working Men's Association was founded for the southeast Chartists. In 1838 the People's Charter was published by a committee made up of MPs and working class men. They had six demands: Votes for men 21-years-old and above (when in sound mind and not undergoing criminal punishment); the secret ballot; no property qualification for MPS; monetary support for those who leave their livelihood to attend to the interests of the nation; equal constituencies; and annual parliamentary elections. A National Convention was held in January 1839 to officially present the petition which had been signed by 1.3million people, though MPs voted to not hear the petition. Riots, marches and plans of uprisings occurred across the country and armed soldiers killed and wounded many chartists at a confrontation in Newport. Over the next few years other uprisings were held and several leaders were arrested and put on trial, receiving sentances of transportation or hard labour; one, Samuel Holberry, died while in prison and became a Chartist martyr. In 1842 amid economic depression, workers went on strike against their reduced wages. The authorities arrested more chartists leaders and imprisoned hundred of men and women who took part in riots. However the arrests did not deter the Chartists and the movement continued, while in 1847 Feargus O'Connor was elected the first and only Chartist MP (representing Nottingham).  Chartist activity increased even further from February 1848 following the news of a revolution in Paris. Riots and demonstrations were organised and Parliament revived a seventeenth century statute that forbid more than ten people presenting a petition in person to deter the crowds. O'Connor ensure that the rules were followed and it was presented by just a few Chartists leaders. However further legislations were passed criminalising activities such as proposing war against the monarch or attempts to intimidate parliament, which were punishable by death or transportation. After 1848, the movement declined rapidly and the requested reforms were not passed.","Malcolm Chase. 2007. Chartism: A New History. Manchester University Press. $  Dorothy Thompson. 1984.

Hasmonean Dynasty Judea,-103,-62,Hasmonean Civil Wars,I c bce,U.susp,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,5,"The Hasmonean civil wars began as an inter-Jewish succession crisis between the sons of Alexander Jannaeus, Hycranus II and Aristobulus II. Hycranus had inherited the throne, but was considered weak willed, and within three months a rebellion was raised by his younger brother. After many of his supports deferred to Aristobulus, and the temple he was taking refuge was captured, Hycranus surrendered and renounced the throne to his brother in 67 BCE. The two reconciled. However at this point, Antipater, who was (likely to have been) governor of Idum√¶a, believed that Aristobulus would not retain him. To secure his position and gain further power, Antipater exploited Hycranus, persuading him to fight for his rightful claim to the throne. They allied with Aretas III, King of the Nabataeans, and an army of 50,000 besieged Jerusalem for several months. The attack on Aristobulus in Jerusalem caused the Roman magistrate, Pompey, who was assigned to the eastern Mediterranean province, to become involved, eventually appointing Hycranus as the ethnarch of Judea, largely because he would be easier to manipulate to the Roman advantage.

However in the Ottoman 1553-54 attack, they captured Yerevan, Karabakh and Nakhjuwan, and destroyed palaces, villas and gardens, and, as the Ottomans proved too great a force for TahmƒÅsp to dare go to battle with, territory was handed over to them and the Peace of Amasya ended the ongoing war. In 1545 TahmƒÅsp assisted Humayan in regaining the Mughal territories that he had lost 15 years previously. Humayan gave the region of Kandahar to TahmƒÅsp, but they later fought when Humayan seized it again on the death of its Safavid governor in 1558. in 1556 TahmƒÅsp had his son Ismail imprisoned for apparently plotting a coup against his father. When TahmƒÅsp died in 1576, Iran was in a relatively calm state, however, two of his nine sons were considered for succession, and their support was divided largely by ethnicities: Ismail was supported by the Turkmen tribes and Haydar received support from the Georgians. 30,000 people turned out to support Ismail and release him from prison. He was enthroned Ismail II in August 1576 and days later his brother, Haydar was executed. Ismail II went on to kill everyone in his family who might pose a threat to his power, except for his older brother, Mohammad Khudabanda (who was blind and therefore not considered a serious contender to the throne) as well as many of his previous supporters. He also changed the official religion back to orthodox Sunni Muslim. In 1577 he was murdered, potentially poisoned by his half-sister, Pari KhƒÅn KhƒÅnum, who had originally supported him in the succession crisis. Upon his death his brother, Mohammad Khudabanda, was selected from three potential candidates for the throne.

His reign was initially successful as he recaptured parts of the empire.

Meanwhile, in the west the Romans posed an ongoing threat.

The Plague of Cyprian hit the Principate between 249-262 CE, devestating entire regions and leading to famine due to the shortage of workers.

The 'secessio plebis' which saw the plebian classes leave the city in protest against the patrician classes who could then not fend for themselves and were forced to negotiate with the commoners. In 494 BCE, the plebeians went on strike, refusing to march to war against a coalition of tribes from central Italy. A settlement was reached when Rome's aristocrats extended to the plebeians the right to vote for certain magistrates, known as the Tribunes of the Plebs (essentially the 'people's magistrates'). This was an important office charged with looking after the needs of Rome's poorer citizens, who held veto powers against decisions made in the Senate. Tensions between the aristocrats and the plebeians lingered throughout the 4th century BCE and after another series of wars against the neighbouring tribes of the Aequi, the Volsci, the Latins, and the Veii, the commoners demanded further rights. The tribuni militum consulari potestate (consular tribunate) emerged briefly during this time of disruption (to be abolished 367 BCE). This was an elected office that could be held both by members of the powerful families and the Roman citizens. In 287 BCE the Hortensian Law was passed to ensure that resolutions passed by the plebian council were final and did not have to be ratified by the patricians. This bought an end to total Patrician rule in the Roman Republic.","Hans Beck, Antonio Duplá, Martin Jehne and Francisco Pina Polo. 2011.

In the weeks and months following his victory Augustus executed all of Mark Anthony's supporters and began passing laws which although gave the oputward appearance of maintaining a Republic, in fact granted even more power and authority to himself.

President D√≠az had been in office for thirty nine years and was increasingly unpopular. Though he claimed he would step aside and not run forhe next election, he later reneged and ran again. Despite Francisco I. Madero challenging Diaz and proving a popular candidate, the election was rigged and Diaz won. Madero led an armed revolt in north Mexico and rebellions began to occur, mainly among agrarian communities. In May 1911 the rebels won a victory at the Battle of Ciudad Ju√°rez, and the army's inability to supress them demonstrated the weakeness of the state against the insurgents. Diaz was forced to resign and in October 1911 Madero won the new election. Though Madero implemented some reforms he did not move on land reform, which prompted opposition from peasentry, agrarian communities, and the previous supporters of the Diaz regime. In 1913 Madero's political opponents and the army, with the help of the US Ambassador staged a coup d'etat, which forced the resignation of Madero and VP Suarez, who were assasinated (known as the Ten Tragic Days). General Victoriano Huerta became president in February 1913, but Governor of Coahuila, Venustiano Carranza, immediately assembled the northern Constitutionalist Army, who, with support from the US which granted arms sales to them, fought and won many successful campaigns against the Federal Army. Huerta resigned and went into exile in July 1914 and the Federal Army was dissolved. The revolutionaries met to agree on political power, but divisions between them meant that civil war was reignited - this time with the Constitutional Army fighting each other. General  √Ålvaro Obreg√≥n led the urban working class to victory against the Villa and Zapata factions in 1915.  The constitutional convention was held in late 1916 after Carranza, who was acting president by this time, held enough support to present a revised constitution, set out the nationalistic, economic and social aims for Mexico, which was really a minor revision of the 1857 constituion and still did not introduce the land reforms that had been fought for. The progressive faction of the Jacobins challenged the lack of land rights while the Zapata and Villa factions continued to be a threat to the government. The constituion was ratified and in February 1917 the Mexican Constitution was presented and Carranza was elected president. However, while in charge Carranza ignored the more radical reforms of the constituion and did not take any action on the promised land reforms. He faced strikes, lost support of the peasentry and agrarian communities, and ongoing conflict from the Zapata factions, which led Carranza to have Emiliano Zapata assasinated in 1919. Carranza's political power and influence was waning and a final rebellion was raised against him. He fled from Mexico City and was ambushed - dying either by assasination or suicide in May 1920. In October 1920 the revolutionary general √Ålvaro Obreg√≥n was elected president.","Womack, John ""The Mexican Revolution, 1910-1920"".

Ruler assassinated: Atahuallpa executed on Pizzarro's orders (Covey 2020: 253). The Inca Empire collpased abruptly at the beginning of the sixteenth century. Smallpox, introduced by European invaders, was already raging throughout the empire. When the Sapa Inka, Huayna Khapaq, died of smallpox in 1528, his sons both claimed the throne, throwing the empire into civil war. Many elites died due to the epidemic and so there was chaos, competition and internal conflicts between them. Many potential candidates for Inca were often put in place by their mothers, the elite 'chosen women' of the court. This also led to these individuals seeking military support and making deals with the Spaniards who arrived in 1532, which led to further conflicts and outbreaks of smallpox.

In 1828 the Dutch East Indies claimed control over the western part of the island. From the start the relations between the indigenous people and europeans were violent and there was killing on both sides. In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the Orokaiva lands of the island of New Guinea were controlled by the competing colonial powers of Australia, Britain, the Netherlands and Germany. By the 1880s Europeans were occupying the island, with the German New Guinea Company administering the northeastern quadrant, and a British protectorate declared over the southeastern quadrant. At the beginning of World War I, Australian forces displaced the German authorities, and in 1921 the League of Nations formalised Australian control over the north eastern quadrant. Britain annexed the south eastern part of the island in 1888, but when gold was discovered shortly afterwards in the northern districts prospectors and miners migrated up island. In 1905 the Protectorate of British New Guinea became Australian territory under the Papua Act. This resulted in administrative change and social, economic and development measures were undertaken by the Commonwealth Government of Australia. By World War II economic development, resource exploitation, and political consolidation had peaked. In early 1942 the Japanese invaded northern New Guinea but were defeated by the Allies and finally surrendered from their ongoing attacks to the islands 1945.

The Russian Army had mutinied after major losses during the war, and parliament established the  Russian Provisional Government which had the interests of the elite classes in mind, while grassroots socialist movements led the lower classes and increasingly leftist urban middle classes, resulting in a dual power in the country. The period was rife with mutinies, protests and strikes. Unable to supress the revolution, Tsar Nicholas II, abdicated on behalf of himself and his son and heir.

All in-service serfs were freed and the practice of serfdom was abolished in the Emancipation Reform of 1861 which granted over 23 million people their freedom and the full rights of citizenship in the Russian Empire.

In 1864 a new judicial systems was created, including a new penal code, and a simplified civil and criminal procedure system such as trials in open court, juries and justices of the peace who dealt with minor local offenses. Educational reforms were brought in between 1858-1863 which allowed women to attend secondary schools and allowed some to audit university courses, private sunday schools were opened, though they were later closed down as the government disliked the innovations they were teaching.

With the shift of the army from a defensive citizen army to professional career soldiers, spending on the military had significantly increased, while by the end of Basil II's reign, the threat of invasion had receeded, and so the mercenary army was an expensive and unneccessary drain on revenue. Efforts to revive the economy resulted in inflation and debased gold. While standing local units were demobilised, the army became more dependant on mercenaries. During the Great Schism in 1054, the Normans began a steady invasion into Byzantine Italy.  Calabria was captured in 1060, in 1068 Bari was taken, soon followed by the seige of the Byzantine stronghold in Apuila which fell in April 1071.

There was division between the north, which had been modernising, expanding and industrialising, and the south which had a principally agricultural economy, fuelled by enslaved people. Though these geographical lines were not absolute, overall, northern Americans began to argue for the abolition of slavery, while southern white americans wanted to retain their enslaved workforce which had made them their fortunes. This came to a head when Abraham Lincoln (Republican Party) who wanted to restrict the expansion of slavery into the newly acquired states, was elected president and sworn in on 4th March 1861. In response, seven southern states (South Carolina, Mississippi, Florida, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, and Texas) formed the Confederate States of America, declared a secession from the United States and in 1861 the Confederacy President Jefferson Davis issued a call to arms to defend the confederacy. Although Lincoln had declared that he had no intention to invade the southern states, nor to end slavery entirely at that point, he continued to arm the Union-held forts in the southern states, including Fort Sumter in South Caroline which on 12th April 1861 the Confederates attacked and captured, officially marking the beginning of the Civil War. Both sides called for volunteers to their causes and after Lincoln requested additional volunteers for a period of three years, the states of  Virginia, Tennessee, Arkansas, and North Carolina also joined the Confederacy. During the war, Lincoln declared the Emancipation Proclamation which freed 3.5 million people from slavery, changing the focus of the war from protecting the union to placing the abolition of slavery as central to the war. After four years of warefare, the confederate states began to surrender on 9th April 1865. On 14th April 1865 Abraham Lincoln was assasinated by a Confederate sympathiser, John Wilkes Booth.

At the same time the European traders were selling firearms to the indigenous tribes, further fuelling their wars against each other. In 1648 the Dutch sold guns directly to the Iroquois, who then launched an attack on Huron territory, destroying many villages, killing warriors and taking thousands as captives.

Under threat of assasination KalƒÅkaua signed the Bayonet Constitution which demanded, among other items, that more power to parliament, removed wording from the constitution that implied the king was above the law, and denied him from appointing any government posts. Immeditately following the new constitution, native Hawai'ins looked to restore the king's power though it was never successful. In 1891, after  KalƒÅkaua's death, his sister Lili ªuokalani became queen of Hawai'i. She attempted to dissolve the previous constitution which her brother had signed under duress, in order to restore power to the monarchy and reinstate the vote for those who did not meet the economic requirements of the Bayonet Constitution. In 1893, pro-American parties, supported by the landing of the US Marines on the island, staged a coup d'etat and overthrew the monarchy, with the end goal of annexing the island to the United States. US Preseident at the time, Grover Cleveland, opposed the annexation and the military force that had been used, and called for the reinstatment of Queen Lili ªuokalani. In the meantime, a Constitutional Government was called to order in an attempt to keep the monarchy from regaining full power, and The Republic of Hawai'i was proclaimed on 4th July 1894. However by 6th January 1895 the Wilcox Rebellion had been raised against the Republic which consisted of three battles in three days, and although the royalists won the first two battles, the final battle in MƒÅnoa was a success for the republican forces who imprisoned many of the rebels and dispersed the rest. When a weapons cache was discovered at Lili ªuokalani's home, the Republic arrested her on 16th January for misprision of treason and forced her to abdicate the throne. After being under house arrest until 13th October 1896, the Republic of Hawaii pardoned Lili ªuokalani and she moved to Massachusetts. During the following year treaties were drafted for the annexation of the Hawaii'an Islands, while native Hawai'ins organised petitions against the annexation. Despite the strong opposition, the Islands were annexed officially on 12th August 1898.","Proto, Neil Thomas (2009).

Us Reconstruction-Progressive,1866,1933,Progressive Era,XX c,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Period of social activism and political reforms often led by the progressive reformers of the middle classes and activists from across society who sought to address problems linked to political corruption, industrialisation and urbanisation. This included the fight for women's suffrage leading to the formation of the National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA) in 1890 and National Women's Party in 1916. The Nineteenth Amendment, which prohibits the US from denying citizens' the right to vote based on their sex, was introduced on 26th August 1920. The development of labour unions in the early 20th century,  particularly the American Federation of Labor (AFL), put pressure on the government to introduce regulations and standards that favoured the worker. This led to the establishment of the Department of Labour on 4th March 1913, while in September 1916 the Federal Employees' Compensation Act granted benefits to workers who became ill or injured in the workplace. Educational Institutions undertook changes to incorporate a rounded education system and improvements to non-academic subjects. Higher level education also gained popularity. Between 1933-39 President Franklin D. Roosevelt enacted public works, financial reforms and regulations, known as The New Deal, which provided support for farmers, the unemployed, youth and the elderly.","John D. Buenker, John C.

Chagatai Khanate,1263,1487,Fragmentation of Chagatai Khanate,XIV c,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,5,"Between 1325-1338 there was religious conflict between the Muslim and Christian population. Tarmashirin Khan (r. 1326-1334) converted to Islam during his reign. He was deposed when an anti-Muslim rebellion was raised against his policy of assimilation between the nomadic and settled population. Tarmashirin's nephew and succesor,  Changshi, enthroned in 1335, was anti-Muslim and had one of his sons baptised. However he was murdered by his family in 1338 and his younger brother, Yesun Temur, who followed the Turko-Mongolic Tengric religion. In the 1340s power struggles among the elite in the west led to a series of emphemeral rulers who were plagued by assainations, plots, and in-fighting. In the meantime the eastern tribes were virtually independant, and they eventually appointed their own khan, Tughlugh Timur. The kingdom was thereby divided into two parts: the western section, Transoxiana, became known as the Ulus Chaghatay, and the eastern, Moghulistan. Tughlugh Timur was a strong leader who reigned until his death in 1363, and temporarily ruled both khanates when he successfully invaded Transoxiana in 1360.","Forbes Manz, B. 1983.

Timurid Empire,1370,1526,Disintegration of Timurid Empire,XVI c,U.susp,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,U.susp,1,U.susp,0,4,"The TImurid Empire was founded by Timur, a Turco-Mongol warlord who reigned from 1370 until his death in 1405. Timur had appointed his sons and grandsons as governors across the empire and upon his death family disputes and succession struggles in 1405-1409, 1447-1451, and 1490-1501 led to civil wars and the independance of several provinces across the empire. Because of the division, both politically and territorially, across the empire, the Timurid power declined rapidly in the second half of the fifteenth century. Neighbouring states such as Aq Qoyunlu and the Safavids, launched successful invasions against the weakened empire, conquering many of the key cities in the first decade of the 1500s, while the Timurids were pushed out of their territories. From Kabul, Babur (a descendant of Timur) founded the Mughal Empire in 1526.","Maria Subtelny. 2007. Timurids in Transition: Turko-Persian Politics and Acculturation in Medieval Iran.

Qasimid Dynasty Yemen,1637,1805,Fragmentation of Qasimid state,XVIII - XIX c,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,3,"Throughout the 18th and 19th centuries the Qasimid (also called Zaidi) gradually fractured into smaller states due to sucession issues and tribal rebellions. In addition, whereas coffee had been produced solely in Yemen up until this point, the imports that started in Java and the West Indies were detrimental to the Qasimid economy and territories. In 1728 the chief representative of Lahej conquered Aden, broke away from the Qasimid State, and declared himself the Sultan of Lahej, creating an independant rule. Around the same time the ruler, Al-Mansur al-Husayn II, was opposed by his brother, the governor of Ta'izz, who kept all revenue from the region for himself. At Mocha the French East India company besieged the city following the governor's refusal to pay his debt of 82,000 dollars. During Al-Mahdi Abbas' reign (1748-1775) he faced religious opposition to his rule following his imprisonment of a Rabbi (who had served the royal family for twenty eight years) and later demolished twelve synagogues in the city of Sana'a. The independant tribes of Hashid, Bakil and Barat also came into conflict with the state several times during his rule. His sucecssor, Al-Mansur Ali I (r. 1775-1809) also had to deal with rebellions by tribesmen, most notably a Sayyid, Ibn Ishaq, who with the backing of the Arhab tribesmen claimed the imamate from 1781-1785, however this was eventually supressed by Ali. Later in his rule, Ali faced worse territorial losses at the hands of the Wahhabi movement which seized territories along the coast of the Arabian Penninsula from 1803.","Ari Ariel (2013).
