Provided that some surplus water could be retained behind artificial embankments or within natural basins, it would have been possible to undertake flood retreat cultivation.

Angkor’s surrounds were converted into an artificial landscape criss-crossed with canals, embankments, reservoirs, dams and other massive engineering works to redirect river flows, store water for the dry season and avert floods by disposing of excess water during monsoons. "" (Diamond 2009, p.480) (Fletcher et al 2008, 658) ‘Between 2004 and 2009 field research led by the University of Sydney’s Greater Angkor Project (http://acl.arts.usyd.edu.au/ angkor/gap/) revealed apparently contradictory information about water damage to Angkor’s water-management network e an admirable system constructed during the Medieval Warm Period’s (MWP) friendlier climate from approximately the mid 10th to mid 13th centuries (e.g., Lamb, 1965). Importantly, sometime between the 12th and the 15th centuries there were significant alterations to the baray that were designed to mitigate water shortages and drought. At the same time vast amounts of sand washed into the canals as the result of water overload. The tree ring-derived climate data constructed by Buckley et al. (2010) helped explain these phenomena by revealing alternating strong and weak monsoons during the 14th and 15th centuries that coincided with the timing Angkor’s demise (see Fig. 6). Droughts were also inferred by Day et al. (2012) for this same period from sediment cores taken from the 8 _ 2 km West Baray. These core samples also revealed an increase in sand deposited the early 15th century, suggestive of wet conditions between the periods of drought and consistent with the Buckley et al. (2010) record. Sinha et al. (2010) noted weak monsoons over India from their Dandak Cave speleothem record, as did Zhang et al. (2008) from Wanxiang Cave in China (Fig. 3).

In the dry season, a hectare would require 15,000 cubic meters (525,000 cu. ft.) of water. Assuming all the major barays at Angkor were full to a depth of three meters (9.9 ft.), they could have supplied 7,000 hectares (17,500 acres). If they yielded 1.46 tons of rice per hectare and annual consumption was 220 kilograms (484 lbs.) of rice per capita, the dry season yield would have maintained about 44,500 people, about 2.5 percent of the estimated population. This calculation is based only on the amount of water available when the barays were three meters deep. It does not take into account the possibility that the barays were constantly replenished with water from the Siem Reap River throughout the dry season. There is also the possibility that the reservoirs were used to supplement water supplies to the fields when there was insufficient rainfall during the wet sea- son. If so, then a further 9,000 metric tons (9,900 tons) over and above anticipated wet-season production could have been obtained, making the total irrigated yield 19,200 tons, sufficient to feed nearly 100,000 people.""

The transition to irrigation regimes was probably uneven (spatially and temporally) and never complete (i.e. higher elevations never used them), and cannot simply be deduced from a single pollen core, settlement patterns, or clear archaeological indicators. The question remains whether irrigation was a gradual evolution, or whether previously unknown sophisticated Wari irrigation canal technology was adopted c.1000 CE in a kind of ""irrigation revolution."" Regardless, irrigation was common in all parts of the Cuzco NGA during the Killke Period. The Killke and Imperial Inca Periods of the Cuzco NGA are characterized by dramatic demographic expansion and agricultural intensification (both extensification of agricultural land use, as well as the widespread construction of irrigated terraced permanent field systems in lowland areas). ""Inca terrace schemes were a direct impact of Inca expansion upon the agricultural landscape available to local communities. They were not as disperssed as state or state-influenced local settlements and show a strong correlation with valley-floor locations and the [Montaña] zone between 2400 and 3200 m in the study region. Mid-altitude crops, such as maize, were apparently the prime targets of production. Terrace location also indicates that most were not so much designed to reclaim steep slopes as to improve other characteristics of the lands of least gradient, such as stone content, water infiltration and drainage. Irrigation canals were invariably incorporated in major schemes and probably enabled increased production and/or greater crop security.

But before this is held most bilek families have taken some measure of independent action. As soon as the sowing of one year's crop has been com-pleted, a bilek family begins to plan the whereabouts of its farm of the following season, and general farming arrangements are premeditated by about two or three years. On my arrival at Rumah Nyala in 1949, for example, the people announced to me that they intended to take two more crops from the area in which they were then farming, and then return to secondary jungle in the main valley of the Sut; and this in fact is what they did. The process of selecting virgin forest for felling is not, however, highly organized, but rather unplanned and casual, with each bilek family acting largely on its own initiative. As already explained, it is usual for a small group of bilek families to operate in the same immediate area. After sufficient consultation to ensure that the plans of others are not being wilfully contravened, a bilek family declares its intention of farming a certain area, by setting up on it a sign, or pesindang, which consists of a notched stick and a cross-piece."" (Freeman, Derek 1955. “Iban Agriculture: A Report On The Shifting Cultivation Of Hill Rice By The Iban Of Sarawak”, 23) ""The duration of fallow periods is in part constrained by the soil conditions prevalent in the hills: 'The hill areas of Borneo suffer from a common tropical phenomenon known as leaching. As in similar areas the world over, great trees paradoxically grow on the thinnest of soils. They are able to do so only because of the rapid cycling of nutrients from dead vegetable matter back to living plants. The nutrients do not accumulate in the soil because the heavy, warm rain quickly leaches them away. When the farmer destroys the forest to plant rice, his crops soon exhaust the shallow reserve supply of plant food in the soil. After one or two harvests, he must fell the jungle elsewhere and prepare a new field, not returning to the old site until a fallow period of up to ten or more years has passed. If he ignores this rule, crop yields rapidly decline and the value of the soil may be permanently destroyed. Only through irrigation, not practical in most hill areas, can the dilemma be solved, for wet rice, unlike the hill variety, is nourished primarily by water-borne nutrients. With irrigation, endless cropping on the same spot may become feasible."" (Pringle, Robert Maxwell 1968. “Ibans Of Sarawak Under Brooke Rule, 1841-1941”, 5p) ""If we turn to the Iban economy as it was at the time of the pioneers, as it is today, based upon the swidden cultivation of hill- padi , supplemented by fishing, hunting and the gathering of fruit and honey and also by other crops such as cucumber, pumpkins, maize and cassava. These latter are grown both intermingled with the padi and around the edges of the swidden. This type of agriculture implies that fields are rotated and not crops and that the basic clearing of a proposed field is done by felling and firing the forest upon it. The resulting woodash gives sufficient nutrients for a few crops but on the poor soils, found in Borneo, yields generally fall off to such an extent after only a couple of crops that the clearing has to be abandoned to lie fallow. The time-span needed for proper regrowth should be not less than twelve to fifteen years, according to present day agronomists, and this is thought to be the ideal mode when available resources of forest are restricted. When the population is spread more thinly, and there is a plentiful supply of virgin forest, there is always the possibility of removing to a different area, although this will entail the wearisome work of clearing whole plots of primary jungle.""

Moreover, late 6th and 7th century Rome was still the largest city in Italy, importing fine-ware and wine, exporting metalwork, and retained a wealthy and powerful elite class compared to the rest of Italy. Thus, due to inferences concerning socioeconomic continuity, I have interpreted the evidence for irrigation from a ""continuist"" standpoint: if the famines, sacks, sieges, and endemic warfare in the Campagna Romana during the Gothic war could not cause the de-intensification of specialized hortus cultivation, then neither could the Lombard invasions and localization of the Italian economy.

A moist subtropical forest biome would have created a rich environment full of exploitable wild foods, also evident from the archaeological record, and thus lower dependence on cultigens. Moreover, moist subtropical forest would have necessitated slash and burn clearing of forests, and heavier rainfall would have quickly leached and eroded loess soils, necessitating shifting plots. Not only does all contemporary archaeological evidence support such a subsistence pattern (e.g. wild foods, low population density, low agricultural intensity, semi-sedentary site occupation, etc.), later archaeologically evident changes during the Late Neolithic clearly indicate a transition to permanent cultivation. As such, the recent scholarship that addresses shifting and permanent cultivation (e.g. Underhill 1997; Underhill and Habu 2006; Brey 1984) state that the Early Neolithic cultures of North China practiced shifting cultivation. Nevertheless, by the 5th Millennium BCE agricultural intensification of Yangshao subsistence patterns makes possible that certain ecological niches enabled permanent cultivation of favored plots (Underhill, A. and Habu, J. 2006.

Nevertheless, several lines of inferential/circumstantial evidence suggest that crop rotation was known to the MYRV by the Western Zhou. Soybeans were domesticates by the Bronze Age at least in the Yiluo Valley, and were an increasingly common cultigen across North China during the Bronze Age. The first direct literary evidence for legume rotation from the 6th century CE Chhi Min Yaoo Shu is decidedly complex, indicating an advanced knowledge of a wide range of legume fertilization schemes used to eliminate fallow entirely and continuously (double) crop year after year.

Thus, it seems very likely that some kind of artificial irrigation system would have been constructed to cultivate wet rice, and possibly to aid in floodplain millet agriculture as well. Nevertheless, deepwater wet rice and floodplain millet cultivation can both be opportunistically grown, and their presence does not necessarily imply artificial irrigation networks. A confluence of recent archaeobotanical, archaeological and archaeobotanical research indicates that a considerable proportion of Late Neolithic cultivation was inundated, but scholars yet to find conclusive evidence of artificial irrigation during this period. Geoarchaeological investigation indicates active aggradation of MYRV floodplains c.5000-2200 BCE, which scholars believe were cultivated as unmanaged drained floodplains (dry millet) as well as artificially irrigated field systems (wet rice).

Within the general administrative context described above, the Qing dynasty (1644-1911) was the first to establish the view that complete centralised control over the Yellow River was critical. The creation of the Yellow River administration (YRA) in the early Qing dynasty was the institutional expression of this sentiment. The YRA was headed by a Director General appointed by the central government. With offices in Jining (Shandong Province), the YRA served as a planning and coordinating organisation for the lower Yellow RIver Basin, the Grand Canal, and the lower Huai River valley. [...] However, central control was not always effective, and in 1855 the lower Yellow River made a major and costly change in course. [...] This the immediate rationale for central control of the Yellow River, namely maintenance of the canal system, was lost. As a consequence, the YRA was abolished in 1856. The removal of central management of Yellow River control ultimately left local and provincial institutions responsible for water management in their immediate locales. The general collapse of Qing provincial and local government institutions, mirroring the deterioration of central capacity, meant that Yellow River management languished.

An emmer wheat/broomcorn millet mixture poses the problem discussed above, as emmer wheat is commonly grown as a winter cereal, whilst broomcorn millet can only be sown in spring."" (Corrie C. Bakels. The Western European Loess Belt: Agrarian History, 5300 BC - AD 1000. Dordrecht, NL: Springer, 2013, p.112-113.) During the first phase of Roman occupation, people continued farming as they were accustomed to, which involved primary reliance on diverse idiosyncratic mixtures of einkorn, barley, emmer, breadwheat, pulses and flax. (Corrie C. Bakels. The Western European Loess Belt: Agrarian History, 5300 BC - AD 1000. Dordrecht, NL: Springer, 2013, p.167.) Although evidence is rather scarce and less than representative, the generalized cereal cultivation proportions of the Late Roman Period (wheat > barley > legumes; bread wheat where possible, hulled generally on loess plateaus) carried over into the Early Medieval Period in northern Francia with two additions: great proportions of rye, and smaller proportions of oats. Emmer wheat was abandoned, fully replaced by spelt. Rye appears too have become the dominant crop in the 5th and 6th century northern Francia, even surpassing wheat, although the evidence suggests that most peasants practiced broad-spectrum cereal cultivation of many different crops simultaneously. Nevertheless, the wheat growing villa economy of Ile de France outlasted its contemporaries elsewhere in northern Francia. Part of the problem with determining crop proportions in Early Medieval Northern France is that neither the textual or archaeobotanical evidence seem to agree or demonstrate any other clear cropping patterns along ecological, economic, or economic lines. Bread wheat continued to be favored in terms of urban demand, which grew over the course of the period, although there is much evidence that spelt was also grown in great quantities throughout the period Barley is strongly represented in both archaeobotanical and textual evidence, followed by oats and pulses, and pulses appear to have been more abundant in archaeobotanical finds than in textual records. The 3-field system of the Carolingian period would have enabled farmers to grow one winter crop (bread wheat, rye, spelt) and then one summer crop (barley, oats, pulses) before a fallow year. Over the course of the Carolingian period spelt lost importance relative to bread wheat due to market demand and the bipartite demesne system. In general, however, it must be stressed that these general trends were highly subject to micro-regional variation in crop choices, since the evidence shows that neither market demand nor ecology were deterministic of crop choices. Thus, bread wheat was by far the most abundently cultivated cereal, followed by oats, and then pulses. Rye was more common in the 15th and 16th centuries, but was gradually abandoned with the increase of urban demand and availability of manure for wheat over the 17th and especially 18th centuries (Hoffman 1996).

Paris Basin,Cropping System,swidden,,,-5300,-2000,,"Using the code of ""swidden"" because only a small proportion of available land was cultivated. Archaeobotanical and geoarchaeological data across the region all indicate that Early Neolithic settlers were not shifting/swidden cultivators practicing slash-and-burn cultivation, but rather permanent cultivators of small plots (Bakels 2013: 34). Local ecology indicates that most of the Early Neolithic sites of the Paris Basin NGA cultivated plots on the lower gravel terraces of alluvial valleys (Bakels 2013; Ilett 1983). Annual re-fertilization through flooding and low yield necessities would have made shifting unnecessary in such an environment...The low site recovery rates for the Early Neolithic NGA make chronological estimation difficult (see ""Human Geography"" above), but the NGA was first settled by migratory LBK farmers sometime between 5300-4900 BCE (Bakels 2013; Rowley-Conwy 2011; Dubouloz 2003; Chartier 2005). Scholars believe that Early Neolithic cultivation practices (i.e. small permanent garden-plots/fields) remained basically constant throughout the period. Scholars believe that Middle Neolithic agriculture in the Paris Basin was basically similar to its Early Neolithic methods, but including minor technological intensifications and probably extensification as well. Indirect evidence suggests that Late Neolithic agriculture in the Paris Basin was basically similar to its Middle Neolithic methods (see ""Cultivation Type,"" above).

P. Wells believes that it already existed in the Hallstatt period, but he offers no proof of this.."" In addition, different scholars have argued for and against legume rotations during the Iron Age. Archaeobotanical studies of weeds during the Iron Age in the Paris Basin demonstrate that fields were fertile (Bakels 2013). Likewise, population/settlement density increased (Bakels 2013; Haselgrove 2011), and corresponding labor intensifications had to be introduced to sustain yields on permanent fields -- in addition to fallow and what manure there was available (Bakels 2013). As such, given these conditions, and the known abundence of legume cultivation, it might be inferred that crop rotation was incorporated into long- and short- fallow rotations to some extent to sustain crop yields. The presence of vetch in archaeobotanical data suggest that this crop were destined for animal consumption, and its nitrogen-fixing capacity may have made it and other legumes and pulses in important on rotation fertilization schemes (Bakels 2013). According to Bakels (2013), fallow, marling, and manuring -- and nitrogen-fixing crop rotation was well known and practiced across the Roman Empire. Some scholars have suggested that fallow was basically uncessary, while others have suggested that regular 1 year long fallow periods were incorporated every so often (Bakels 2013: 191-192; though she does not say how often).
